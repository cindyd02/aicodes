            <h3>Involving Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>A brief poll of Computer Engineering faculty (in CS and ECE) yielded the following: Adwait Jog, CS, Xiaoxuan Yang, ECE, David Evans, CS, Brad Campbell, CS/ECE, Avik Ghosh, ECE, Nikhil Shukla, ECE, Daniel Graham, CS, Homa Alemzadeh, ECE, Amanda Watson, ECE. If the RIG proposal is awarded we will expand our outreach beyond CS/ECE, also reaching out to other stakeholders beyond faculty, specifically undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs, and the community at large.</p>
