            <h2>About AI-CoDes RIG</h2>
            <p>AI hardware-software co-design is an interdisciplinary approach that focuses on the concurrent development and optimization of both hardware and software components for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This approach is crucial because AI applications often have unique and demanding requirements that can be best met by designing hardware and software components to work together seamlessly. Its societal importance lies in driving innovation and making AI accessible while addressing critical challenges such as: enhancing performance, energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and safety.
            </p>
            <h3>School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) Strengths in the Area</h3>
            <p>In SEAS there are strengths in AI mainly in the CS and ECE departments, with stronger emphasis on software for CS and on hardware for ECE, thus with great opportunities for interdisciplinary activities at the intersection of hardware and software for AI. AI however is spread across all departments, so, while this RIG is an initiative of the interdisciplinary Computer Engineering program, it is intended to be inclusive to other departments in SEAS. This explicit effort to combine the AI hardware and software strengths in SEAS will try to achieve the proverbial “whole bigger than the sum of the parts.”</p>
