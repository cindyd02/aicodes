            <h2>Specific Plan for the Research Interest Group</h2>
            <h3>Description of planned activities: </h3>
            <p>A main activity will be to pursue high-impact research projects which will target critical issues in AI hardware-software co-design to yield influential research outcomes. Examples of such projects will include responding to calls from industry (such as the call from <a href="https://research.facebook.com/research-awards/2022-request-for-research-proposals-for-ai-system-hardware-software-codesign/" target="_blank">Facebook/Meta</a>) or funding agencies (such as the call from NSF for <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/national-artificial-intelligence-research/nsf23-610/solicitation" target="_blank">AI Institutes</a>).
            </p>
            <h4>Workshops</h4>
            <p>Another activity will be to organize an annual Workshop on AI hardware/software codesign at UVA and submit papers and participate in international conferences in the field such as the International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS). The annual workshop will be used to encourage industry collaborations by actively seeking partnerships with tech companies for joint research initiatives. Collaborative projects, co-authored papers, and technology transfer agreements will enhance the group's reputation, while participating in these events will showcase UVa's leadership in the field. Both the CS and ECE departments have general invited speaker series; with this RIG we will complement what the departments are doing with a more focused regular series of talks and seminars in AI hardware-software co-design. These events will be posted as webinars on YouTube/LinkedIn to attract attention from within and beyond UVA. These events will also help with outreach by engaging with the broader community through the workshops and webinars while promoting awareness and understanding of AI hardware-software co-design's importance.
            </p>
            <h4>Student Engagement</h4>
            <p>To ensure student engagement we will also organize AI hardware-software co-design student competitions or hackathons, encouraging students to participate and showcase their skills. This will help identify and nurture emerging talent while preparing them for careers in the fields of AI and Machine Learning.</p>
            <h4>Research Opportunities</h4>
            <p>Another effort will be to try to forge academic partnerships with other institutions and research centers to facilitate interdisciplinary research and knowledge exchange. UVA is already involved with two AI Institutes (the Institute for Agricultural AI for Transforming Workforce and Decision Support (AgAID) and the AI Institute for Agent-based Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation (ACTION)) but they are not relevant to this RIG, so we will try to engage with other AI Institutes that have relevance to AI hardware/software codesign (<a href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2023-05/AI_Research_Institutes_Map_2023.pdf?VersionId=GtBfiPXUI3e_RePJ6Ub2y5UVfhPdKKct" target="_blank">full list</a>) in order to eventually be able to lead an AI Institute proposal.
            </p>
            <h4>Open-Source Iniatives</h4>
            <p>Another activity will be to engage and participate in open-source initiatives related to AI hardware-software co-design, such as the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/projects/ai-hw-sw-codesign" target="_blank">OCP effort</a>, ensuring active community involvement and recognition.
            </p>
            <h4>Long Term Goal</h4>
            <p>A longer-term goal will be to create an AI hardware/software codesign degree program to offer both masterâ€™s and doctoral degrees in this interdisciplinary field (<a href="https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/all-stories/advancing-hardware-software-codesign-ai-enabled-systems" target="_blank">example from OR State</a>).
