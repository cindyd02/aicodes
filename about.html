            </p>
            <p>SEAS strengths in the area:</p>
            <p>In SEAS there are strengths in AI mainly in the CS and ECE departments, with stronger emphasis on software for CS and on hardware for ECE, thus with great opportunities for interdisciplinary activities at the intersection of hardware and software for AI. AI however is spread across all departments, so, while this RIG is an initiative of the interdisciplinary Computer Engineering program, it is intended to be inclusive to other departments in SEAS. This explicit effort to combine the AI hardware and software strengths in SEAS will try to achieve the proverbial “whole bigger than the sum of the parts.”</p>

            <p>Existing or emerging opportunities to increase the research reputation of UVA Engineering:</p>
            <p>There are many opportunities in the area of AI hardware/software codesign, including industry partnerships, organizing conferences/workshops, collaborative research centers, recruiting faculty and students, public engagement, etc. By pursuing these opportunities, SEAS/UVA can elevate its reputation in the field of AI hardware-software co-design, attracting talent, research funding, and industry recognition.</p>
